    <string name="doggo_common_description">Dogs are a lot of responsibility - having to make sure
        they get walked enough… and needing to make plans for
        them when you want to go out of town, etc…  BUT IT IS SO WORTH IT!
        Dogs are awesome. No other creature will adore you and be there for
        you as much as a dog who is loved. Any love and attention you give them
        is returned tenfold… Especially if you rescued them from a difficult life.</string>
